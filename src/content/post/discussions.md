The course materials and most of the activities are in the [github discussions](https://github.com/orgs/csevaluationcrisis/discussions) site. 

Note that this is a private repository for participants in the seminar. Later in the semester some more materials may be posted here, but unlike [other courses](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/courses) I have led where nearly everything is public, for this seminar it seemed there were enough advantages to keeping our discussions in a private group that most seminar materials will not be posted here.
