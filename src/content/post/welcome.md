Welcome to cs6501: Evaluation Crisis in Computer Science!

This is the public course website for UVA's cs6501 Fall 2024 seminar lead by [David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans).

Our first class meeting will be on Wednesday, August 28 (11:00am in Rice 340).

A [preliminary syllabus](/syllabus) is now available, and should give you a good idea what to expect in the seminar, although it is not yet finalized.

More material will be posted here as the beginning of the semester approaches.
